##UPDATE: you don't need this any more since Homebrew now has its own `fishfish` recipe.



### Homebrew-fish: tap-ready formula for [Fish's fish](http://ridiculousfish.com/shell/), the new fork of fish shell.

First, make sure you Homebrew version is 0.9 or above (you can check your brew version with `brew --version`).

After tapping this repo with

    brew tap edc/homebrew-fishfish

You can install with just one line of command:

    brew install fishfish

If you want to stay on the edge and use the latest and greatest from GitHub:

    brew install --HEAD fishfish
